        <p>
            My name is Megan Lockette. I'm 26 years old and I'm from Oakland, California. Growing up, I wanted to be pretty much, every profession you could possibly think of; from a school teacher to a Victoria Secret Angel. In 2011, straight out of my senior year of high school, I went to San Jose State University and majored in Business Management. Well into my third year, I failed my first class ever!!! It was calculus for "business and avaiation students". I remember thinking, "Why am I in the same math class as aviation students?" I thought long and hard and began reflecting back on the courses I took outside of my major that I really enjoyed. The one that stood out the most was Sociology 101. I knew then I had to drop my current major and take the necessary steps to switch to Sociology.
